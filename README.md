# NegentropicIDE

Note!! This now lives as part of [https://github.com/illuminated-g/lv-ide-snippets](https://github.com/illuminated-g/lv-ide-snippets) and is combined with the snippets repository along with being built into a VIPM package.

Project Provider Framework adds tools to the Project Explorer to speed up development without adding additional dependencies.

To use this, clone this to the LabVIEW XXXX\resource\Framework\Providers folder and then copy the NegentropicIDE.ini file to LabVIEW XXXX\resource\Framework\Providers\GProviders folder.

This master branch is developed in LabVIEW 2020 Beta. This Provider should work back to LV 2012 and follow these instructions with the 2012 branch to use with an earlier version of LabVIEW.
